# Dataset preparation artifacts

This folder was generated by `prepare_dataset.py`.

## Files
- `lists/train.lst` — one URI per line (training set)
- `lists/dev.lst`   — one URI per line (development set)
- `lists/test.lst`  — one URI per line (test set)
- `rttm/*.rttm`     — merged RTTMs per split
- `uem/*.uem`       — full-coverage UEMs per split
- `database.yml`    — ready-to-use protocol for pyannote

## Splitting policy
Session-aware splitting using the last **2** folder(s) of the relative path as the group key. All files
sharing the same key are assigned to the same split (to avoid leakage).

## Counts
- train: 218
- dev:   26
- test:  22

## Next steps
Load `database.yml` with `pyannote.database` and proceed to tuning/training.
